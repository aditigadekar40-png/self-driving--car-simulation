Short Introduction

This is a simple Self-Driving Car Simulation Game built using Python and Pygame.
The player’s car (red) moves forward on the road while avoiding the blue obstacle cars.
If the car collides, a Game Over message is displayed.

 Features

Smooth car movement
Random obstacle car spawning
Continuous road scrolling
Collision detection
Game Over display
Simple graphics (road, cars, lanes)
