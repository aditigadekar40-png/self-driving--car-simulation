## Theory / Background

### Self-Driving Car Simulation
A self-driving car simulation is a software environment that models the behavior of autonomous vehicles.
The main purpose is to test algorithms and vehicle behavior in a controlled environment before deploying in real life.

### Key Concepts
- **Sensors and Perception:** Simulated sensors detect lanes, obstacles, and traffic signals.
- **Path Planning:** The vehicle decides the best path to follow based on road and traffic conditions.
- **Control Systems:** Algorithms control the vehicle’s speed, steering, and braking to follow the path safely.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Detecting obstacles and taking corrective actions to avoid collisions.

### Simulation Goals
- Understand vehicle dynamics in a safe virtual environment.
- Test lane-following and obstacle-avoidance algorithms.
- Visualize autonomous vehicle behavior in different scenarios.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** for simulation logic.
- **Pygame / Matplotlib / OpenCV** (depending on project) for visualization and environment modeling.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations and data processing.
